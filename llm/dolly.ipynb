      "Nuclear fission is the breaking down of a single atom of uranium or another fissile material, producing many smaller particles called neutrons which are very likely to interact with others to produce more atomic nuclei, and generate additional radiation. In contrast, nuclear fusion is the process where two or more atomic nuclei (two or more atoms each carrying a positive electric charge) combine together, turning part of the positive charged inner nuclei into positively charged particles called ion nuclei (positive charged particles) and part of them into photons (ultraviolet light). Both nuclear fusion and nuclear fission have been proposed as explanation for the observed processes in the universe, but the discovery of the process of fusion in the sun in 1960 was a major step towards a viable nuclear fusion energy technology.\n"
